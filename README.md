# 👋 Hi, I'm Abraham Abrar

### 🚀 Senior Backend Engineer | Distributed Systems | Python, Django, FastAPI

I design and build **scalable, reliable, production-grade backend systems** — from API architecture and system design to deployment, infrastructure, and horizontal scaling.  
Focused on **core engineering, performance, reliability, and real-world product systems**.

## 🧭 Software Engineering Principles  
**Focus: High-performance, scalable, production-grade APIs**  

> Build only what is necessary. Avoid over-engineering. Optimize for clarity, reliability, and scale.

### 🏗️ 1. Architecture & System Design
- Modular services / microservices mindset  
- Separation of concerns, single responsibility, DRY  
- OOP where it improves clarity and structure  
- Clear boundaries between API, domain, and infrastructure layers  
- Avoid circular dependencies and tight coupling  
- Services should be independently deployable and testable  
- Prefer explicit API layers (DRF APIView / FastAPI routers)  
- Goal: Systems that are **easy to change, scale, and reason about**

### 🛡️ 2. Stability, Reliability & Maintainability
- PEP-8 compliant, clean, readable, consistent codebases  
- Strong type hints for safety and long-term maintainability  
- Traceable, debuggable exception handling  
- Use `transaction.atomic()` for multi-step critical operations  
- Idempotent APIs where applicable  
- Production-first, predictable behavior  
- Goal: Codebases that **survive long-term evolution without breaking**

### ⚡ 3. Performance & Efficiency
- Target: **< 200ms** latency for critical APIs  
- Prefer **O(1)** or **O(log n)** execution paths where possible  
- Optimized queries, proper indexing, bulk operations  
- Avoid N+1 queries and unnecessary joins  
- Redis caching for hot paths with proper invalidation  
- Memory-efficient data handling and CPU-aware logic  
- Async/background tasks for heavy workloads  
- Horizontal-scaling-friendly designs  
- Goal: **Blazing fast, cost-efficient, resource-aware systems**

### 📡 4. API Quality & Consistency
- Structured, consistent response formats  
- Explicit and complete payloads  
- Strict input validation (DRF serializers / Pydantic)  
- Meaningful error messages with correct HTTP status codes  
- API versioning, pagination, and rate limiting  
- Logging for critical paths, warnings, and failures  
- Goal: APIs that are **predictable, debuggable, and consumer-friendly**

### 🔐 5. Security & Compliance
- Brute-force protection and abuse prevention  
- SQL injection prevention and input sanitization  
- Secure authentication flows and RBAC  
- Environment-based configuration and secret management  
- Encryption where required  
- Goal: **Secure by default, hardened by design**

### 🔍 6. Observability & Operations
- Structured, searchable logging  
- Monitoring, metrics, and health checks  
- Tracing mindset for debugging distributed systems  
- Deployable, testable, rollback-friendly services  
- Infrastructure-aware design (VPS, Docker, Nginx)  
- Goal: Systems that are **operable, diagnosable, and predictable in production**

### 🧰 7. Engineering Best Practices
- PEP-8, clean architecture, consistent patterns  
- Modular, scalable, testable designs  
- No unnecessary abstractions  
- Avoid over-engineering; build what is needed  
- Microservices principles: independent deployability, clear contracts  
- Goal: **Simple systems that scale, not complex systems that break**
